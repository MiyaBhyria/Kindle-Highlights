“You may have beaten us for now, but we will again become what we once were—a free people.” It was this that allowed me, when I met someone, regardless of his social or intellectual level, to know immediately whether he was Algerian or not.

Sadly, the university taught us nothing about our country or our people. We learned more through our activism than through our studies—from our families and neighbors, our visits to the hammam and to the combatants’ families, and also our chief. Thanks to them, we knew exactly what the colonial press, which took its orders from the regime, meant by “law enforcement operations” and “pacification.”

In these French-on-French verbal altercations, the ultras saw this misery as proof of the almost genetic inferiority of the Muslims, who should “thank God for having sent the Europeans to civilize them,” while the tiny center-left minority viewed it as the consequence of an error of economic and social strategy that could be corrected by creating a few jobs and opening a few literacy and vocational training classes.

Samia reminded her that “Camus is fully French, while we are ‘natives,’ that is to say beings with inferior rights, with no access to citizenship or French nationality. And since we are colonized, we also don’t have the right to be Algerian. In short, we are neither French nor Algerian; we are ‘nothing’ to the French government. We are a people denied even its essence and its existence, a people that has undergone a system of absolute and intolerable domination for 126 years! To top it all off, this system declares that Algeria is part of France. Which means that the Europeans and Camus are at home here and that we are strangers in our own land.”

And as for Camus’s reports in Alger Républicain, we have read them. In his eyes, our problem is poverty due to unemployment and illiteracy, while for us, the misery is only a consequence of our true problem, which is called French colonization. For him, systemic reforms are sufficient, while for us, the solution lies in the death of the system that he is part of.

The message was clear: Algeria must remain French. The colonial system, with its slate of domination, humiliation, oppression, misery, repression, and nullification for the “natives” alongside the outrageous political, economic, and cultural privileges of the European minority, would stand. For this it was necessary, through total war and “special powers,” to crush the separatists and quash any attempt by Muslims to join them.2 The French people’s elected representatives, including the Communists, would spare no expense.

“I hope you are aware of the significance of your decision, and that you understand its gravity and all its implications. It doesn’t only commit you. Sooner or later, the whole family will suffer for it, but that is the lesser evil, because we will face it head on. The question I pose to you is this: Do you believe, in your soul and in your conscience, that you are able and ready to confront every imaginable situation? Listen well—this is not novels and poetry. It is a war of liberation where the rule is ‘win or die,’ which implies a necessarily harsh, violent, even cruel reality at all times. These are situations that you cannot even imagine—you can only know them by living them. Tell yourself that this will be very hard, often unbearable for a young girl like you. Tell yourself that your discipline must be ironclad, that there is no room for sentiment, no qualms, because everyone is responsible for his life and that of all others, but most importantly for the victory of the cause. France will be merciless. They have a vast army and security services well versed in the most inhumane methods to break you down and destroy you. Your books and your law classes will be of no service to you, since the Rights of Man and Citizen, the declaration of 1793, are only valid for their people. Not for us. So here’s what we’ll do. I am going to get a room at the Hotel Aletti. You think carefully about everything I’ve just told you, and if you change your mind, come find me before noon tomorrow and we will return home.”

I often watched her when she applied her makeup, which she did ritualistically, with great care and consideration, as if it weren’t merely a beautification process but a moment of transcendence. With six children, a full-time job, and the world’s weight on her shoulders—in a country continually teetering on the edge of collapse—she was surrounded by constant chaos. But her hand never wavered when she applied her eyeliner; it was as if the world had come to a standstill. Steadily, and with great precision, she would close one eye and swipe the kohl applicator along her waterlines, allowing both rims to catch the pigment. When she opened her made-up eyes, I marveled at her beauty.

Our nineteenth century was one of mass slaughter that made rivers of our ancestors’ blood flow, thousands of hectares of their land burned and seized, and countless cities, towns, and villages ransacked and set alight. Our twentieth century was no better; the massacres of May 8, 1945, and August 20, 1955, ended up serving as fuel for the fire that our brave combatants lit on November 1, 1954, and that would not be extinguished until our country’s liberation, and rightly so. We had always believed that our misfortune, our bondage, our negation as a people and nation went hand in hand with the system of settler colonialism.

We had always considered it better to die with honor in the armed struggle for dignity and liberation than to survive in the disgrace of tolerating colonization—and by settlement, at that.

we weren’t human beings? It seems we were not! Never was our people’s status as human beings in our own right, with the sacred rights that went with it, considered or even suggested. At best, they saw us as idle hands for whom someone needed to create a few more jobs, and empty bellies to whom someone needed to throw a few more scraps. Could the “natives” desire freedom and dignity like all peoples? Could we commit to these values, even to the point of making the supreme sacrifice? That was what we held as more than just an ideal, it’s what shaped our souls and our deepest beings in 1956, as it does today. In a free and independent country, these questions could be a harmless intellectual concern for a student thesis. For Samia and me they constituted a life-or-death issue, individually and collectively. And even when viewed with a critical eye, we considered (and still consider) that only those who had “tasted” the colonial system as we had could respond to it.

Our first duty, if we are to defeat them, is to never lose sight of this abominably unjust and completely asymmetrical configuration. Only with this reality in mind will we understand France’s objective: to defeat us militarily by literally crushing us, physically eliminating us, and holding all the means to do so: raids, arrests, torture, executions, and ferocious repression. “Meanwhile, it is by keeping this configuration in mind that we will oblige France to meet us on a different battlefield: the political one, where it can never win. That is why our ambushes, our attacks, our bombs, and all the rest must help us to defeat France politically and to diminish it morally and symbolically. We are not killers. We are fighters for a just cause, moved by the most sacred of duties: to liberate our land and our people. It is the colonial regime that kills—torturing, oppressing, and repressing to perpetuate its system of occupation on our land and our people, trying to convince everyone that Algeria is French. That is why each of our attacks, each of our ambushes, each of our lives sacrificed must serve to unmask France before the world, to show that our people are at war against a foreign power occupying us by force. To do this, our people have established a political organization, the FLN, and an armed organization, the ALN. That is the meaning of the primacy of the political over the military, which is a fundamental principle of our revolution. To that point, I invite you to read and analyze the platform of the Soummam Congress, which explains our revolution’s aims and philosophy.3 “Before letting you go, I want to ask you to stand by to lead a crucial awareness campaign to mobilize our people, as the Algerian question will soon be debated at the UN. The challenge is to demonstrate that the FLN legitimately represents our people. You see, it is thanks to the struggle of our brothers in the ALN in the maquis and in the cities, and also thanks to the bombs in the European city, that the world has become aware of our cause and that the UN has agreed to include the Algerian question in the General Assembly’s agenda. This is a great first victory for the FLN, and hence for all our people. It is the meaning of the primacy of the interior over the exterior, the other fundamental principle of our revolution. So go, and know that I am counting on you. Until next time, good luck.”

Across from her, Yemma sat cross-legged, upright, her eyes dry and lips chanting in silence as she fingered her prayer beads. Her impressive, dignified presence was like a gauntlet thrown at the feet of the paratroopers who had defiled the sacred mourning rites. They stared at her as if hypnotized, with a glimmer of fear in their eyes. She seemed to be telling them, “I am unbreakable Algeria! You killed my son, but you remain the foreign army of occupation. I will bury as many children as it takes to throw you out! And out you will go!”

I know it is difficult to ‘humanize’ war, but I actually think that if the French government stopped inflicting the indignity of death by guillotine on our fighters, our entire population would support the initiative you are offering: to stop bombing the European city in exchange for an end to executions by guillotine. However, and excuse me for repeating it, we were forced by your side, by its system and its methods, to go to these ends.”

They had to transform the French courts into a forum for denouncing colonialism. As for the lawyers, they had to expose this travesty of justice, its iniquity, and its bias and demonstrate that the French justice applied to the Algerians was an integral part of the colonial system, against which the accused fighters had arisen to liberate their country. Because of that, this “justice” was incompetent and unfit to judge them; it could not be both a judge and a party to the case.

The Algerian people they so despised and the FLN they hated just as much responded less than a year later by bringing the war of national liberation to their home front back in France, thus fulfilling Ben M’hidi’s prophecy to his assassins: “France will see war, from Dunkirk to Tamanrasset.” In fact, from August 1958 onward, the FLN launched—thanks to the men and women fighters of the FLN’s Federation of France—a series of spectacular attacks on military and economic targets such as weapons factories, airfields, fuel depots, and refineries, but also police, soldiers, ultras, and Muslim elected leaders who had betrayed our country. For the first time in the history of decolonization, a colonized people, the Algerian people, brought their war of liberation back to the colonizers’ homeland. This people, long despised, humiliated, deprived, and massacred, would give their ultimate response, the fatal blow to “French Algeria,” on December 11, 1960, in Algiers, when demonstrators flooded the city streets. As if to say that Ben M’hidi, Ramel, Si Mourad, Dahmane, Ali, Hassiba, and all the others were not dead, it swept over Algiers like a torrent that nothing could hold back. From all the “native” quarters—so often ransacked, bruised, and outraged—a powerful human wave of children, youths, and women struck the European town, unarmed, throats unprotected, faces uncovered, shouting in the face of the French army and government their commitment to the FLN—their one and only representative—and their unwavering determination to live freely and independently. They were already waving the national flag.

In the aftermath, it was neither my arrest nor my detention for five years that have tormented me. Those were the risks of my commitment, of choices that I made in good conscience. What has always tormented me is the fear that the living, especially our youth, might forget the sacrifices made by our people—that they might forget the price paid for Algeria to be free and independent, and therefore forget how it must always be defended. My hope now is to have the energy and strength to deliver my testimonial—to our youth—about my years in detention alongside dozens of sisters, about the euphoria of independence and then the difficult work of building our country. Inchallah, if God grants me life. Long live Algeria, free and independent, All honor and glory to our martyrs, Zohra Drif

When i was in the Black Panther Party, we used to call the police “fascist pigs,” but i had called them fascists not because i believed they were nazis but because of the way they acted in our communities. As many times as i had referred to police as fascists, these shocked me by the truth of my own rhetoric. I later learned that the state troopers in new jersey was started by a German, that their uniforms were patterned after some type of German uniform (very similar to the uniforms South African police wear), that they are notorious for stopping Black, Hispanic, and long-haired people on the turnpike and beating, harassing, and arresting them.

But I never could make much sense out of war. I remember being taught that World War I was the war to end all wars. Well, we know that was a lie because there was World War II. I remember a teacher telling us that World War I was started because Prince Ferdinand, somewhere in Austria, got killed. (When we learned history, we were never taught the real reasons for things. We were just taught useless trivia, simplistic facts, key phrases, and miscellaneous, meaningless dates.) I couldn’t understand it. What were people all the way in amerika doing in a war because some prince got killed in Austria? I could just imagine going home and telling my grandmother that i got in a fight because some dude in Europe got killed.

The more i watched how boys and girls behaved, the more i read and the more i thought about it, the more convinced i became that this behavior could be traced directly back to the plantation, when slaves were encouraged to take the misery of their lives out on each other instead of on the master. The slavemasters taught us we were ugly, less than human, unintelligent, and many of us believed it. Black people became breeding animals: studs and mares. A Black woman was fair game for anyone at any time: the master or a visiting guest or any redneck who desired her. The slavemaster would order her to have six with this stud, seven with that stud, for the purpose of increasing his stock. She was considered less than a woman. She was a cross between a whore and a workhorse. Black men internalized the white man’s opinion of Black women. And, if you ask me, a lot of us still act like we’re back on the plantation with massa pulling the strings.

how you dress and how you look have always reflected what you have to say about yourself. When you wear your hair a certain way or when you wear a certain type of clothes, you are making a statement about yourself. When you go through all your life processing and abusing your hair so it will look like the hair of another race of people, then you are making a statement and the statement is clear. I don’t care if it’s the curly conk, latex locks, or whatever, you’re making a statement.

glow. From the paintings on my walls to the big, fat pillows on my floor, from the incense burning in the air to the music dancing through the rooms, my whole life was moving to African rhythms. My mind, heart, and soul had gone back to Africa, but my name was still stranded in Europe somewhere. JoAnne was bad enough, but at least my mother had given. it to me. As for Chesimard, well, i could only come to one conclusion. Somebody named Chesimard had been the slavemaster of my ex-husband’s ancestors. Chesimard, like most other last names Black people use today, was derived from massa. Black folks went from being Mr. Johnson’s Mary and Mr. Jackson’s Paul to being Mary Johnson and Paul Jackson. Sometimes, before dozing off to sleep, i would lie in bed and think about it, wondering how many slaves Chesimard had owned in Martinique and how often he beat them. I would stare up at the ceiling wondering how many Black women Chesimard had raped, how many Black babies he had fathered, and how many Black people he had been responsible for killing. So the name finally had to go. I thought about Ybumi Oladele, but there was one problem. I didn’t know what the name meant. My new name had to mean something really special to me.

I was surprised to learn that there were all different types of capitalist countries and different types of communist countries. I had heard “communist bloc” and “behind the iron curtain” so much in the media, that i had naturally formed the impression that these countries were all the same. Although they are all socialist, East Germany, Bulgaria, Cuba, and North Korea are as different as night and day. All of them have different histories, different cultures, and different ways of applying the socialist theory, although they have the same economic and similar political systems. It has never ceased to amaze me how so many people can be tricked into hating people who have never done them any harm. You simply mention the word “communist” and a lot of these red, white, and blue fools are ready to kill.

watching what was going down. The first thing we did was ask for a lineup. The way i had been “identified” was from a photo. The FBI had selected my photograph from the “militant casebook.” This book contained the photographs of all the “militants” the FBI wanted to send to prison. After they had gotten my photograph out of the “militant casebook,” they put it in with a few other photographs of women. Of course, mine, a mug shot, was the only one with numbers across the front of it. The rest were normal. The FBI then showed this group of pictures to the robbery witnesses and asked them to identify someone who “somewhat resembled” or “bore a likeness” to the woman who robbed the bank. Two of the people who were in the bank signed affidavits saying that the photograph with the numbers across it, my mug shot, looked somewhat like the woman.

Can the deep childhood impulse to trust one’s mother, to agree with her against oneself, ever be wrestled down by the comparatively thin force of reasoned argument? Are there even reasoned arguments to be made in matters of love, marriage, intimate life?

Attachment, the cause of all suffering, so the Buddhists say. To cling to what you have, what you have had, the life you have known, the handful of people and places you have ever really loved, to cling and not let go. Never relenting, never accepting, becoming all the time more enmeshed, holding harder, loving and hating more.

No one is perfect. Sometimes you need people to be perfect and they can’t be and you hate them forever for not being even though it isn’t their fault and it’s not yours either. You just needed something they didn’t have in them to give you. And then in other people’s lives you do the same thing, you’re the person who lets everyone down, who fails to make anything better, and you hate yourself so much you wish you were dead.

In fact a swimming pool requires, once it has been filled and the filter has begun its process of cleaning and recirculating the water, virtually no water, but the symbolic content of swimming pools has always been interesting: a pool is misapprehended as a trapping of affluence, real or pretended, and of a kind of hedonistic attention to the body. Actually a pool is, for many of us in the West, a symbol not of affluence but of order, of control over the uncontrollable. A pool is water, made available and useful, and is, as such, infinitely soothing to the western eye.
